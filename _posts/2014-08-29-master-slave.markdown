A relationship with a woman is much like a relationship with alcohol. As the late, great Christopher Hitchens said, it's a master slave relationship - you have to get more out of it than it does out of you.

Have a handle on your emotions and state control. A man who can control his thoughts can control his destiny. We are our habits. Start forming positive habits and thought-loops that elevate your state and consciousness. 

How?

Stay tuned.
