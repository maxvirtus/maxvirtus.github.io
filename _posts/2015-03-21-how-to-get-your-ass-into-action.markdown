You know you're the shit. You have what it takes to reach successes that others think are reserved for the extraordinary. You see people who succeed and don't see them as a far stretch away from yourself. But there's a problem. You're not living their life, you're not enjoying the successes that they are, and you find yourself in the middle - not the bottom nor the top but that the annoyingly comfortable, shit-ain't-that-bad, i-can't-complain, i-have-it-better-than-most middle. What are you supposed to do? How should you go about reaching your full potential?

The answer is discipline, plain and simple. There are no shortcuts to this. Deep down you know what you need to do, what the first and most important thing is. There are [no hacks](http://maxvirtus.com/self/2015/03/21/are-you-a-hack.html). Get a pen and paper and outline what you need to do to get to your goal. It could be a to-do list or a mind-map. Whatever, get it down on paper and slowly tackle each bit one by one. There is no replacement for hard work, blood, sweat and tears. Seeking a better method, whether it's the pomodoro technique, a bullet journal, using a TODO app or subscribing to /r/GetDisciplined on Reddit will not get you closer to your goals - these are all methods of procrastination. These are for the weak-minded. They may help you get started but they don't cultivate the hard-grit you need to get your hands dirty and etch your legacy.
