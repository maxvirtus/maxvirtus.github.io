The everyday toil and grind, countless responsibilities and tasks and stresses of life can wear on you slowly and knock you off balance. It's insidious and often you find yourself in a rut and you don't quite know how you got there. You indulge more and more in low-consciousness stimuli like binge-watching movies, video games and junk food. You hammer yourself with stimuli to keep you busy and distracted from the reality of your situation - that you need to re-align and get back in touch with yourself. 

Anything worth doing is hard. Sometimes sitting back, switching everything off and taking the time to listen to yourself and meditate seems like the hardest thing to do. But it's the most important.
