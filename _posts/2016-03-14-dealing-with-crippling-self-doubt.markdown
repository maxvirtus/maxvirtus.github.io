**TLDR: Employ the Strategy of the Crown from Law 34 to get out of moments of self-doubt and despair caused by plateaus in your journey.**

We all hit a point of depression at some point along our journey. We feel that it's too hard, and a sense of hopelessness washes over us. Why is that?

We work, work and work and toil and we see no end it sight. No payoff. The idea of seeing fuck all from it is disheartening. It’s a secret hope that we all have that it will be easy if you just push a little. A blue pill fantasy that at some point it'll all be OK. 

But isn't life just one giant hell-hole with shit upon shit upon shit flung at you like in the movie The Revenant? When does the struggle end?

Maybe you have to accept the fact that it's just shit all the way and enjoy the nice things as and when they come. Can you enjoy a life like this?

To get out of this funk and move forward you need to first take a step back. Meditate. You’ll begin to notice mental patterns taking shape in your head that lead you to this state of despair. Now what?

Night is darkest just before the dawn. Understand that the shit, the suck, that hopeless dip, the plateau that yields no rewards for your efforts won't last forever. Don’t just endure this period but use it for growth. Take it as an opportunity to become better. 

**How can I use this as growth?**

Reflect on yourself: What are my shortcomings? What exactly is bothering me? Isolate the issue and you’ll be better equipped to tackle it. Then focus on the positives: I’ve already come so far because I’ve learned xyz about myself in this journey. 

Accept that you’ve come a long way and there may be a lot still to do but it takes time and all you need is consistent action and over time it will compound like a mutha fucka. Life is up and down. Realise that if you’re in a down, you’ll soon be in an up. 

If you don’t know what to do next, a good technique is to model success. Do what someone else did in a similar situation as yourself. But do it in a way that’s in line with your values and character. 

From Law 34: Be Royal in your Own Fashion

This is what we usually do that hinders our growth and reaching our full potential:

1. We setup boundaries
2. We come to expect less from life
3. We accept limitations that are really self-imposed
4. We bow, scrape and apologise for the even the simplest of requests

The Solution: 

1. Force yourself in the opposite direction
2. Downplay failures, ignore limitations
3. Demand and expect A LOT, as you did as a child

^^ This is the strategy of the crown.

**Lesson Learned:**

A quote will say this better than I can:

>“Believe in yourself and believe in your potential. By being confident in yourself, you will win opportunities missed by others. In fact, we can sometimes be our biggest enemies. We make up excuses and inhibitors which ultimately hold us back. By being confident in yourself and your abilities, you will attract women who can respect a man who respects himself. If you feel destined for greatness, this will in turn make others believe that you really are destined for greatness.”
