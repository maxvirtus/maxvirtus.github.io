The modern narrative makes it seem that you can easily learn, master, and reinvent yourself many times over by employing the latest life-hacks. Promises of 21 steps to success in whatever-you-feel-like-being-today abound and it's your job to separate the wheat from the chaff. Here's a tip: it's ALL chaff. Use these hacks as an overview of the subject, much like you would a textbook's contents page, but know that there are no shortcuts in life to anything worthwhile. You may be able to sneak in a few external quick wins but your foundation will be lacking and soon enough you'll falter and not have the bedrock to bounce off of when you do.

The process is what matters - it's the journey and NOT the destination that matters. Commit to your dreams and work the process that will get your closer to your goals. Through the grind, hard work and toil you will have carved yourself out of stone and painted your dreams with vivid colors on the blank canvas that is your life's potential.
