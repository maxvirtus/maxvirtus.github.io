**Don't be crap at Tinder ever again.**

This book is about teaching you *how to message girls on online dating apps* like Tinder and Hinge and starting a conversation and *carrying it all the way through to setting up a meet*. More broadly speaking, it’s a book about concepts, strategies, mindsets and real-life examples to help you reach your full potential as a man in terms of lifestyle and maximizing your attractiveness to the opposite sex.

The texting is just a practical way to show how all the pieces fit together to achieve the results you want. After all, language and communication is the external representation of your internal models. What goes on on the inside in your mind - how you see yourself, your self-esteem and what you believe is possible - will be reflected in the way you interact with the world and people around you.

Many of the ideas in this book may collide with your strongly held beliefs about how a man should behave or interact with a woman but don’t be fooled by the mainstream narrative tells you about what women want. We have real-life interactions with girls that will challenge and shatter your views about how a man should interact with a woman and will finally pull the curtain on the secret society that you’ve never been a part of where girls embrace their femininity, celebrate masculinity and its qualities, sex is abundant and awesome fun times are to be had. 

Certain ideas may seem a little out-there to guys just starting out but they’re included to get a specific point across: what is acceptable and attractive depends heavily on who’s doing it. If Corporate Bob tries to pickup chicks at a bar he’s called a creep and a pervert. When 50 Cent’s raps about “Open my eyes, no surprise, I'm with a different bitch, different day, different ass, different tits.” We all just shrug and say, well, that’s 50 Cent for ya. Why can’t you play by the same rules as 50 Cent? The good news is that you can. It’s all about mindset and communicating that mindset in the best possible way. And that’s exactly what this book is about. Enjoy.
